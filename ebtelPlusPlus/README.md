# ebtel++

[![Build Status](https://github.com/rice-solar-physics/ebtelplusplus/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rice-solar-physics/ebtelPlusPlus/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

ebtel++ is a C++ implementation of the two-fluid EBTEL model, as detailed in [Barnes et al. (2016)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...829...31B), for doing efficient hydrodynamics of dynamically-heated solar coronal loops. The EBTEL model was originally developed by [Klimchuk et al. (2008)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...682.1351K) and [Cargill et al. (2012)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...752..161C). This code provides an enhanced description of plasma behavior above roughly 5 MK. Further generic details about EBTEL can be found in the [repository for the original IDL code](https://github.com/rice-solar-physics/EBTEL) and in the references listed below.

## Installation

First, [make sure you have the needed dependencies](http://rice-solar-physics.github.io/ebtelPlusPlus/#dependencies).
Then, clone, compile, and run the code using the example configuration file in `config/ebtel.example.cfg.xml`,

```Shell
$ git clone https://github.com/rice-solar-physics/ebtelPlusPlus.git
$ cd ebtelPlusPlus
$ scons
$ bin/ebtel++.run
```

This will create a results file `ebtel++_results_file.txt` in the current directory. For more info about which parameters can be passed to `ebtel++.run`,

```Shell
$ bin/ebtel++.run --help
```

For more information about how to setup the configuration file, see the [documentation](http://rice-solar-physics.github.io/ebtelPlusPlus/).

This code uses [`tinyxml2`](https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2) for parsing the XML configuration files for each simulation.
TinyXML-2 is a simple, small, efficient, C++ XML parser that can be easily integrated into other programs.
