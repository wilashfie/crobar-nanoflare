environment:

	install scons from apt/yum (linux) or brew (macports). For debian and variants (ubuntu, mint, etc) should just need
		sudo apt install scons
	 
	For Mac:
		if you install boost via brew, and depending on the version you use, you will need to approprialty update the SConstruct file to point to this install. Something like:

		if 'darwin' in sys.platform:
			print("Using Mac OS X compile options.")
			env.Append(CPPPATH=['/opt/local/include', '/usr/include/malloc','/opt/homebrew/include/'])
			env.Append(LIBS=['boost_program_options'])
			env.Append(LIBPATH=['/opt/homebrew/lib'])

		you might also need to set cxx_flags = ['-std=c++14',]
	
	
	install conda (if absent) and make environment:
		conda create -n crobar-heating
	active and install standard solar packages to environment:
		conda activate crobar-heating
		conda install jupyter numpy numba matplotlib scipy astropy sunpy
		
	run ebtelplusplus compilation:
		cd ebtelPlusPlus
		scons

	slice_em3d.ipynb -- missing, produces sliced 3d emission...
	load_em3d.ipynb -- loads sliced 3d emission and downsamples to make heating map, done in separate notebook due to memory issues
